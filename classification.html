						<h3>Celadon (青瓷）</h3>
						<p class="colour_p">　　Celadon is a type of ancient Chinese porcelain that is made from kaolin clay and fired at temperatures of up to 1,300°C or higher. Its fine, hard flesh and crystal-clear glaze, with a greenish-gray glaze color, gave it its name.

							<br>　　The origins of celadon can be traced back to the Eastern Han Dynasty, when it was first fired in the Jingdezhen area of Jiangxi Province and then gradually spread throughout the country to become one of the representatives of ancient Chinese ceramics. The firing process of celadon is relatively complex, requiring several processes such as sifting the clay, mixing, making the tires, applying glaze, applying color, and firing. Its high firing temperature and long firing cycle required exquisite skill and experience.
							
							<br>　　Celadon reached its peak in the Song Dynasty, when it became one of the main varieties of porcelain fired. With its simple shape, smooth lines and lubricious glaze, celadon products were widely used in everyday life and in the cultural arts. In recent years, celadon, as one of the important representatives of traditional Chinese culture, has received more and more attention and love.</p>

						<h3>Black porcelain (黑瓷) </h3>
						<p class="colour_p">　　Black porcelain is a type of porcelain produced in China and is known for its deep hue and unique texture. Its production history dates back to the Tang Dynasty, but it really became a separate category of porcelain in the Song Dynasty. The firing process and technique of black porcelain is very complex and requires exquisite craftsmanship and skill.

							<br>　　Black porcelain usually has thicker tires than other porcelains because it needs to be fired at high temperatures, which makes it stronger than other porcelains. The glaze of black porcelain has a black or dark brown sheen due to the control and atmosphere to which the glaze is subjected during the firing process. The decoration of black porcelain is usually plain and simple, emphasizing the beauty of the form and texture of the vessel.
							
							<br>　　In Chinese culture, black porcelain is often seen as an understated, restrained aesthetic, representing an attitude of simplicity and modesty. It is also one of the vessels commonly used in Chinese tea ceremony culture and is considered to be in tune with the spirit of tea culture.
							
							<br>　　Today, black porcelain remains one of the most important categories of Chinese ceramics and is loved by collectors and ceramic enthusiasts both at home and abroad.</p>

						<h3>Green glaze (绿釉) </h3>
						<p class="colour_p">　　Green glaze is a common color in ceramic glazes and is one of the common glaze colors used in traditional Chinese ceramics. Green glaze first appeared in pottery during the Eastern Han Dynasty, and over time reached its peak during the Tang Dynasty when it became one of the main glaze colors for Tang Dynasty ceramics. Green glaze is usually made in two ways: copper green and iron green.

							<br>　　Copper green glaze is made by adding copper powder or crushed copper to the glaze and firing it to form a green glaze. During the firing process, copper oxide is reduced, resulting in green copper oxide minerals that give the glaze its green color. Copper green glazes are often used to make ceramic objects such as celadon, porcelain and architectural tiles.
							
							<br>　　Iron green glazes, on the other hand, are created by adding iron powder or crushed iron to the glaze and firing it to create a green glaze. During the firing process, iron oxide undergoes reduction, resulting in the production of green iron alumina minerals that give the glaze its green color. Iron green glaze is commonly used to make yellow-glazed and green-glazed earthenware objects.</p>

						<h3>Doucai porcelain (斗彩) </h3>
						<p class="colour_p2">　　Doucai porcelain is a type of painted porcelain from the late Qing Dynasty, known as "doucai" because of its strong contrast and vivid colors. It was originally created during the Kangxi period by the master painters of the official kilns to imitate the export porcelain from Jingdezhen. The process is to paint a layer of white glaze on white porcelain, then paint various patterns, and then fire it for a second time.

							<br>　　The patterns of Doucai porcelain are mostly figures, landscapes, flowers and birds, and auspicious patterns, etc. The colors are usually composed of purple, green, red, yellow and blue. The key to making Doucai porcelain lies in mastering the matching of colors and expression, which is difficult to make and is one of the treasures of Chinese porcelain making technology.
							
							<br>　　The development of Doucai porcelain could not have been possible without the contribution of Lang Shining, an artist who was an imperial court painter. Lang Shining was proficient in Western painting techniques and fused them into traditional Chinese painting techniques to create a unique style of Doucai porcelain painting, which laid the foundation for the development of Doucai porcelain. Today, Doucai porcelain has become one of the representatives of traditional Chinese culture and art, favored by collectors and art lovers.</p>

						<h3>Ancient copper-colored porcelain (古铜彩) </h3>
						<p class="colour_p2">　　Ancient copper-colored porcelain is a type of porcelain made using a special painting technique, which features a white porcelain base, using metal oxides as pigments and painting them to produce a colorful, gold and copper-like luster. The history of antique bronze-colored porcelain dates back to the Tang Dynasty, but its heyday came during the Ming Dynasty, particularly during the Jiajing years.

							<br>　　The process of making antique bronze-colored porcelain is very tedious, requiring the firing of a white porcelain body into shape, followed by the application of a clear glaze on the surface and then the painting of designs on the glaze. The pigments used in antique bronze-colored porcelain are mainly metal oxides such as iron, copper and cobalt, which can produce different chemical reactions at high temperatures to form unique colors and textures. The production process requires multiple firings and glazes, with each step requiring careful control and blending.
							
							<br>　　Antique bronze-colored porcelain reached its peak during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, when both its production techniques and artistic value were highly recognized. Antique copper-colored porcelain not only circulated widely within China, but was also widely exported around the world.</p>

						<h3>Gold-colored porcelain (金彩) </h3>
						<p class="colour_p2">　　Gold-colored porcelain is a kind of porcelain with gold color as the main decorative element. Gold-colored porcelain first appeared in the Tang Dynasty, and then further developed in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. The decorative motifs of gold-colored porcelain usually feature flowers, birds and animals, landscapes and figures, and are painted with golden minerals, with graceful and smooth lines and shining golden luster, which have high artistic and ornamental values.

							<br>　　The production process of gold-colored porcelain is quite tedious, requiring multiple firings and glazing. It is painted with gold color on plain porcelain, fired once, then glazed, and fired a second time. Because of the high firing temperature of gold-colored porcelain, the production process is difficult, the production period is long, and the cost is relatively high, so gold-colored porcelain has always been regarded as a precious product.
							
							<br>　　Gold-colored porcelain has not only occupied an important place in Chinese history, but also had a profound influence on the development of ceramic art around the world. For example, in Europe in the 17th century, there was a kind of imitation product called "gold-colored porcelain", whose patterns and techniques were derived from Chinese gold-colored porcelain, which is an important contribution of Chinese porcelain to the cultural exchange of porcelain in the world.</p>
